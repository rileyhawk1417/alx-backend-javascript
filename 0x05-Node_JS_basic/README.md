# Description

This project has everything to do with building a web server in nodejs.

In the `full_server` folder everything is built with [express](https://expressjs.com/).
As for the other files outside its a mix of the `http` nodejs package and abit of express.

These are not the only ways to build a server, but they are the most used ways to build a server.
