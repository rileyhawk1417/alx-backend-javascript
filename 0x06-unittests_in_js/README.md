# Description

This folder demonstrates on how to write unit tests in javascript.
It's using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the test runner. Both [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) & [Chai](https://chaijs.com/) are used in some files, although they can be used separately.
There are `package.json`'s in their respective folders just run `npm install` and it's ready to test.

When running the test suite for chai use version 4. `npm install --save-dev chai@4`

You can run the tests individually using `npm test file.js`.
Or you can use `mocha` if you have it installed globally `mocha file.js`
